# DDF-Project
A 3D unity game 

In an endless hell, Shadow monsters on the wall try to attack MC, but MC is not the target, its shadow is. 

The player controls the main characterâ€™s movement to adjust its shadow projection on the wall. 

By moving away from the light source or moving to the light source, the main character can shrink shadow to avoid bullets or enlarge shadow to scare away shadow monsters.

The longer the player survives,the more the game would become difficult and  the more points the player will get.
