In an endless hell, there is nothing but emptiness and darkness. One day, you, a suffering lich, used your last power to create a light source. it is the first and only light in hell.

Where there is light, there is shadow. Not only that, there are shadow ghosts. Their only purpose is to enlarge themselves by taking your shadow.

Even without your life, you still own your body and knowledge. Moving to avoid little ghosts taking your shadow. When a big ghost shows up, always remember: "Even a very small lich can cast a very large shadow."
